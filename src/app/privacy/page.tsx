 *   journal des accès, 24 mois            prisma/schema.prisma (DatasetAccessLog), /terms
 *   suppression d'un dataset              src/lib/sirius/provider.ts (deleteDataset : clé détruite, unpin)
 *   IP : limitation de débit en mémoire   src/lib/http/rate-limit.ts (requestClientKey), jamais en base

 * Aucun outil de mesure d'audience ni de publicité : seuls des cookies strictement
 * nécessaires, donc pas de bandeau de consentement. `privacy.test.ts` vérifie ces points.
